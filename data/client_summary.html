                <div>In 1978, Arthur Blank co-founded The Home Depot. Starting as president, he served in increasing roles of responsibility before retiring in 2011 as co-chairman. Arthur’s current portfolio of businesses includes the Atlanta Falcons; PGA TOUR Superstore; The Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation; Mountain Sky Guest Ranch; MLS Atlanta; and AMB Group, the parent company of his for-profit businesses.

In 1995, Arthur founded The Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation, for which he serves as chairman. Since its inception, the foundation has granted nearly $300 million to support early childhood development, education, the arts, and parks and greenspace. Arthur currently serves on a number of boards including the Board of Trustees of The Carter Center, Inc.; the Board of Trustees of The Cooper Institute; and the Board of Directors of Cox Enterprises, Inc.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> Passion drives Blank’s philanthropic giving.

Arthur has openly stated while there are many issues in need of financial support, his foundation will invest in the areas that his family has “the most personal passion.” As evidenced above, this is primarily limited to charitable causes in the local Atlanta, GA region.</div>

                <div>Chris Hughes is one of the four co-founders of Facebook. Chris served as Facebook’s fist spokesperson before joining its product team in Palo Alto, CA. He made an estimated $600 million in Facebook’s IPO. In 2007, Chris left Facebook to serve as the director of online organizing for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.

In 2012, Chris purchased a majority stake in The New Republic. He served as the publisher and editor-in-chief of magazine before selling it in 2014. His short tenure was not without controversy as nine of twelve senior editors submitted letters of
resignation following Chris’ decision to shake up the magazine’s editorial leadership.

Openly gay, Chris is married to Sean Eldridge, who ran unsuccessfully as a candidate in New York’s 19th congressional district.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> While Chris’ philanthropic giving is still in its nascent stages, he focuses his financial support on issues where his contributions will be the “most effective.” Over the past two years, this has become narrowly focused on direct cash transfers. He currently serves on the board of GiveDirectly, a nonprofit organization providing help to those living in extreme poverty through unconditional cash transfers via their cellphones.

Aside from his philanthropic initiatives, Chris and his husband Sean have emerged as a significant force in political circles, becoming distinguished New York fundraisers for the progressive issues they support.

Similar to Mayor Bloomberg, Chris recognizes the importance of private philanthropy to serve as a testing ground to cultivate effective programs that can later be scaled through public initiatives.</div>

                <div>Christy Walton is the wealthiest woman not only in the U.S., but also in the world, more
than $1 billion wealthier than L’Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt. In the U.S., the next
richest is her sister-in-law Alice Walton, who trailed by $3 billion as of mid-September
2014. Christy married into what is now the richest family in the world (worth more than
$150 billion) and inherited her wealth when husband John Walton, a former Green
Beret and Vietnam war medic, died in an airplane crash in 2005. She’s the wealthiest
of the Waltons thanks to a side investment by John that turned into a major score:
solar energy company First Solar. Her nearly 27% stake is worth some $1.8 billion. The
bulk of her holdings are in Wal-Mart, the massive retailer founded by her father-in-law
Sam Walton and his brother James in 1962. She will receive $470 million in Wal-Mart
dividends after taxes in 2014. Walton leads a very private life in Jackson, Wyoming.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> Outside of Alice Walton’s Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, the
Walton Family Foundation directs the majority of its spending to education reform where they are
endeavoring to “infuse competitive pressure into America's K-12 education system."

The Waltons are funding the education reform movement in two ways: through the Walton Family Foundation and through local-level political donations.

Since 2000, members of the Walton family have spent at least $24 million funding politicians, political action committees and ballot issues at the state and local level that favor their approach to school reform.

The political activities of the Walton family and Walmart frequently intertwine and reinforce each other, even when it comes to education reform.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> Eli describes his approach to philanthropy as entrepreneurial; however, other have described it as similar to negotiating a business deal "Eli does nothing without strings." It is not altruistic. It is not blind charity.
Eli makes no apology for his exacting demands on how the millions he has donated are spent, nor the consequences for failure. He has been known to pull his financial support if results don't meet his initial expectations.</div>

                <div>Fred Eychaner is a Chicago-based entrepreneur, political activist and philanthropist. A graduate of Northwestern, Fred founded Newsweb Corporation in 1971, a printing
business for foreign-language and alternative papers that expanded into a print, radio and television conglomerate. Worth an estimated $500 million, Fred is one of the
nation’s top political fiancers, yet is rarely interviewed or profiled in the press.

An openly gay man, Fred is heavily involved in gay rights issues. In 2008, Fred organized and funded a successful effort to pass same-sex-marriage legislation in Illinois. Calling it the “most important issue of my life,” AIDS has also been a major focus. He is the largest donor to the AIDS Foundation of Chicago, and was instrumental in the formation of Equality Illinois -- the state’s most influential gay-rights advocacy group.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> Fred consistently appears on the list of top U.S. political contributors; however, unlike his political contributions, which are publicly disclosed by law, his charitable donations are predicated largely on condition of anonymity.

His Alphawood Foundation, which he initially intended to call “Anonymous,” contributes almost exclusively in Illinois. Its gifts often focus on providing restoration and operating funds to architecture projects and dance initiatives.

A trend across both spectrums of his giving is his personal desire to create change (“I am a basic social activist”) rather than amass clout, which he is broadly recognized for among Democratic power players.</div>

                <div>Fred Wilson is a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, which has invested

environment, including Twitter, Tumblr, Disqus, Delicious, Feedburner. Foursquare,
Meetup, and Boxee. Wilson has been a venture capitalist since 1987. In 1996, Wilson
co-founded Flatiron Partners with partner Jerry Colonna.
Fred’s has become the most prominent voice for early stage investing. His blog,
AVC, is the number one most read blog in the national venture community, with over
100,000 monthly visitors. Wilson earned an M.B.A. from the Wharton School and holds
his B.S. from MIT. Wilson is married to Joanne Wilson, a Venture Capitalist focused

                <div>Commentary: <br /> Wilson is a strong advocate of “philanthrocapitalism”, having led panels on the public service
potential of private capital. He’s also written several blogs related to philanthropy, such as one
on markets and philanthropy, and another asking if crowdfunding could be more patient than
traditional venture capital, particularly when it comes to funding for charitable causes.
Fred has also let it be known that the money he makes from his blog (AVC) is donated to charity,
(around $25,000-$30,000) but didn’t say where it went, which seems to be typical of his approach
to philanthropy: he’ll occasionally advocate for a cause and use his substantial network to do
some fundraising, but the details of his own personal contributions usually remain private.
Wilson’s primary areas of giving include Education, Net Neutrality and the NYC community.</div>

                <div>George Lucas is one of the most prolific figures in Hollywood history. A California native, George attended junior college in Modesto before transferring to the University of Southern California’s filmmaking school. In 1972, George formed Lucasfim. A year later, George wrote and directed American Graffi (1973), which is still considered on the most successful low budget features ever made and paved the way for creation of his most successful franchise: Star Wars. In 1977, George’s fist installment of Star Wars grossed $513 million worldwide in its original release, solidifying George’s reputation as a world-class film director. In 2012, George sold Lucasfim to The Walt Disney Company for a reported sum of roughly $4 billion.

In addition to his career in Hollywood, George has been an active advocate for education reform. Frustrated with his own experience in the public education system, George founded the George Lucas Educational Foundation and an accompanying website, Edutopia.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> As George transitions from his career in Hollywood to devoting his time to philanthropic causes, education remains his number one priority, calling it “the key to the survival of the human race.”

The majority of George’s assets are housed under The George Lucas Foundation; however, it serves as the parent organization underwriting both the George Lucas Educational Foundation and Edutopia.

While focused almost entirely on K-12 education reform, George has also donated large sums to the University of California to expand its film school and has pledged significant resources to the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, which is slated for a 2018 opening in Chicago.</div>

                <div>Born in Brooklyn, New York, on July 19, 1953, Howard Schultz graduated from Northern
Michigan University with a bachelor’s degree in communications before becoming
director of retail operations and marketing for the Starbucks Coffee Company in 1982.
After founding the coffee company Il Giornale in 1987, he purchased Starbucks and
became CEO and chairman of the company. In 2000, Schultz publicly announced that
he was resigning as Starbucks’s CEO. Eight years later, however, he returned to head
the company. In 2014, Starbucks had more than 21,000 stores worldwide and a market
cap of $60 billion.
Through his VC firm Maveron, Schultz also has stakes in Groupon, eBay and Pinkberry
frozen yogurt. Howard and his wife Sheri live in Seattle with their two children.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> Howard Schultz and his wife, Sheri, signaled they are gearing up their philanthropy by hiring Daniel Pitasky, a Gates foundation veteran, in October 2013 to run their family foundation. Mr. Pitasky, the grant maker’s fist executive director, will be working to expand the organization’s efforts. Since his hiring, the foundation launched two notable programs - Onward Veterans (with a $30,000,000 investment) and Onward Youth.

Prior to hiring Pitasky, Schultz’s foundation gave piecemeal grants of a few hundred or a few thousand dollars to a wide range of community, educational, and Jewish organizations, many of them based in Seattle.

Among organizations the Schultz foundation has supported in the past: Jewish Family Service in Seattle, the Robin Hood Foundation, and YouthCare, a Seattle nonprofit helping homeless youth.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> Skoll is a highly innovative founder, but takes on only a small number of new grantees (or
investments) each year. One big focus of his climate funding lately is improving climate advocacy
through better sharing of information and learning.

The Skoll Foundation is a model of philanthrocapitalism, i.e., harnessing business savvy to
improve societal and environmental well-being, and not just to accrue capital. Skoll calls it social
entrepreneurship: driving large-scale change by using innovation to disrupt the status quo.

One of the things that distinguished Skoll from most other foundations was that he focused on
finding good people and betting on them, rather than focusing on particular issues or program
areas. Over time, he has refined this approach, creating a grid of the issues in the world that Skoll
feels are most important.</div>

                <div>In 1977, Larry Ellison founded Oracle Corporation, a major enterprise software company specializing in database management systems. He served as the company’s CEO until September 2014, when it was announced that he would step down as CEO but retain the title of chief technology offer.

According to Forbes, Larry is the world’s fifth richest person. With the reputation of an “adrenaline junkie,” Larry is known for his financial backing of the Oracle Team USA sailing team. In recent years, Larry has amassed a significant number of properties on the Hawaiian island of Lanai, which he bought for a reported $300 million in 2012.

In 2010, Larry committed to The Giving Pledge claiming that he had already invested virtually all of his assets into a trust with the intent to give away 95 percent of his wealth to charitable causes.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> While having reportedly donated one percent of his personal wealth to charitable causes, The New York Times described him as the “biggest surprise” among the 40 other billionaires who committed to The Giving Pledge in 2010.

For years, he had quietly given hundreds of millions of dollars to medical research. The relative low visibility of his initial giving reflected his belief that charitable giving is a “personal and private matter.” This was later criticized when he withdrew his $115 million pledge to Harvard University following the departure of former president Lawrence Summers.

Over the years, his philanthropic giving has since broadened to support education, global health and development, and wildlife conservation, among other causes, albeit the causes still appear to be personal and at times rather spontaneous.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> The Paul E. Singer Foundation takes a targeted, results-oriented approach to philanthropy,
seeking measurable outcomes of its work in the medium to long term.

Whenever possible, Singer’s Foundation seeks to leverage its own philanthropic investments by
partnering with proven non-profits and like-minded founders.

Singer, who has a gay son, turned his attention toward gay-rights issues more than a decade ago
and has been giving generously to various gay-rights initiatives since.

Marriage equality, Singer has said, is an issue that doesn't or at least shouldn't fit into any tidy
partisan box: it crosses all sorts of lines. After all, gay and lesbian people can be present in any
family, any community.</div>

                <div>Paul Tudor Jones II is the founder, chairman and CEO of Tudor Investment Corporation. Paul
founded the firm in 1980, at 26, and achieved the status of a Wall Street legend following his short
of the market before the October crash in 1987, delivering a 201% gain for his fund that year.
In 1988, Paul founded the Robin Hood Foundation, an organization dedicated to the singular
mission of ending poverty in New York City. In the past 25 years, the foundation has raised more
than $1.95 billion. Additionally, he serves as Chairman of The Everglades Foundation and spends a
substantial amount of his time to natural resource conversation efforts.
In 1988, Jones married Sonia Klein, a New York-based yoga entrepreneur. The couple, along with
their four children, live in Greenwich, CT. Paul graduated from the University of Virginia and has
donated over $44 million to his alma mater.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> The Robin Hood Foundation practices a “venture philanthropy” philosophy, in that cash is
solicited and then deployed in a quantitative, results-based manner. Due diligence and attentive
monitoring is a prerequisite for every investment. If expectations are not met, funding is
discontinued. In essence, the foundation’s operations mirror that of Paul’s hedge fund.

At the end of 2013, the foundation primarily focus shifted to reforming the public education
system, aiming to leverage its influence to effect public policy. Paul, who has historically been
media adverse, has recently acknowledged the importance of stepping into the spotlight to
influence and engage all key stakeholder groups on the issue.</div>

                <div>Peter Thiel was born in West Germany in 1967. In 1985, Thiel entered Stanford. Two years later, he started The Stanford Review, a right-wing student newspaper that now
serves as the university’s main conservative/libertarian newspaper.

After graduating from Stanford Law School, Thiel co-founded of PayPal with Max Levchin and Elon Musk and served as its CEO. PayPal was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. More money came from an early investment in LinkedIn and most notably for getting an opportunity to own 10.2 percent of Facebook - a stake he acquired for just $500,000 in 2004 - back when it was just called “the facebook.” This ensured Thiel’s billionaire status.

Thiel lives in San Francisco, California.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> The Thiel Foundation has a limited number of projects that work to advance Peter Thiel’s unconventional vision. It funds anti-aging research, and created and is the primary founder of the Seasteading Institute, which seeks to build independent city-states in the ocean.

Thiel’s contrarianism is notorious, and he appears to delight in saying or doing the unexpected, even at the risk of ridicule.

Thiel believes he supports the free enterprise system by helping people become entrepreneurs. In support of this vision, the Thiel Foundation gives a handful of college students $100,000 each year to drop out of school and pursue risky startups. This program, dubbed “20 under 20”, is in contrast to the large number of foundations who insist that giving heavily credentialed people late in their careers large sums is the right way to give.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> Recognized as one of the fist to adopt a venture capital approach to philanthropy, the Omidyars have been philanthropic innovators and powerful advocates for a variety of causes. Distinguishing between charity and philanthropy, they focus on developing philanthropic teams that can create long-term transformational change.

Unlike other philanthropist who funnel their money through a single family foundation, the Omidyars have pursued their philanthropic missions through three different major charitable organizations: the Omidyar Network Fund, HopeLabs, and Humanity United.

The aversion to a single centralized philanthropic entity reflects their emphasis on the need to remain flexible and dynamic, and to adapt constantly.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> Sean describes himself as "very strange philanthropist" in that he doesn't follow the traditional model of writing large, blanket checks. He is averse to working through the
bureaucracy of a development office. Instead, Sean's giving approach is two-pronged: he supports center-leaning political candidates who have shown willingness to work
across the aisle and, by his estimate, has directed about $20 million in grants to support cancer immunotherapy research.
Sean is a canny contributor who demands a clear sense of how his money is spent. His medical grants are conditional.</div>

                <div>Seth Klarman is the manager of Baupost, one of the world’s largest hedge funds. While attending Harvard Business School, Seth’s professors, impressed with his  market acumen, formed Baupost and recruited Seth to manage the fund. Since its inception in 1982, Seth has grown Baupost’s assets under management to roughly $26 billion. Known for his bottom-up approach, Seth has been called a “younger Warren Buffet” for his conservative yet highly profitable strategy of value investing. Seth outlined this approach in his 1991 book, Margin of Safety: Risk-Averse Value Investing Strategies for the Thoughtful Investor. Outside of Baupost, Seth is one of the main investors behind The Times of Israel, an online English-language newspaper that reports on Israel, the region and the Jewish world.

In 1991, Seth and his wife Beth set up the Klarman Family Foundation, for which Beth currently serves as president. They have both committed to The Giving Pledge.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> For their charitable giving, the Klarmans have three chosen areas of focus: civic and community (most notably music education), scientific and medical research (particularly in the area of behavioral health) and Jewish causes (including support for
the State of Israel).

In his letter to The Giving Pledge, Seth noted that society’s problems appear to compound faster than his wealth accumulation, implying his recognition of the limitations of his philanthropy and conveying his importance of targeting only the
areas where he thinks he can maximize his giving’s impact.</div>

                <div>A graduate of Harvard University, Steve Ballmer dropped out of Stanford Business School to become Microsoft’s 30th employee in 1980. Over the next 34 years, Steve served in increasing roles of responsibility at Microsoft, including as its CEO from 2000 to 2014. Among his many accomplishments and missteps, Steve is largely recognized for tripling Microsoft’s profits during his 14 year tenure as CEO. In 2014, he surpassed Bill Gates as the company’s single largest individual shareholder. Shortly after stepping down from Microsoft, Steve purchased the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion. As part of the deal, $200 million was earmarked to form the Los Angeles Clippers foundation, which Steve will co-chair with Shelly Sterling, the wife of former Clippers owner Donald Sterling. In 1990, Steve married Connie Snyder. Over the years, Connie has been deeply involved in Seattle-based non-profit work.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> The scale of the Ballmer’s philanthropy increased dramatically in November 2014 when the couple announced major donations to their alma maters ($50 million to Oregon and $60 million to Harvard).

Described as “analytical to a fault,” Ballmer is crafting his philanthropic giving plan with what his wife describes as an “economist’s precision” -- looking for gaps in the current system as well as ensuring he avoids any irreversible steps of committing a sizable portion of his fortune into a foundation.

While his grand philanthropic vision is still undetermined, he has waved off the notion of following Warren Buffett’s example and passively submitting his wealth to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to manage. He intends to chart his own path.</div>

                <div>Steven A. Cohen is the founder of SAC Capital Advisors, once one of the world's most famous
hedge funds. SAC has since been renamed Point72 Asset Management following a highprofile
insider-trading investigations and an ultimate settlement with federal prosecutors. After
graduating from The University of Pennsylvania, Steve worked for 12 years at Gruntal & Co, a New
York brokerage firm, before founding SAC in 1992. He became a star of the emerging hedge fund
world in 1999 when he delivered a 68 percent return to his investors by backing dotcom stocks,
and then did even better the following year by selling them as the bubble burst.
Over the past decade, Steve has amassed an extensive art collection estimated at $700 million.
The collection has earned him spots on Art News' "Top 10" list of biggest-spending art collectors
and on Forbes' "Top Billionaire Art Collectors" list. In early 2014, Steve stepped down as director of
the Robin Hood Foundation after serving for 10 years on its board.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> Given SAC Capital Advisor's guilty plea with the Southern District of New York, the scope of
Steve's future philanthropic initiatives remains uncertain.
Prior to the settlement, Steve expressed an increasing interest in politics as "a way to express a
view of what needs to be done in the country;" however, his political giving has been relatively
non-existent over the past two years.
Steve maintains that his charitable giving will only continue to increase. With this in mind, his wife,
Alexandra, is widely considered the "central" figure in guiding their foundation's grantmaking,
which focuses on three primarily areas: military veterans, children's hospitals and education.</div>

                <div>Tom Steyer is the founder and former Co-Senior Managing Partner of Farallon Capital
Management, LLC. Steyer stepped away from Farallon on Jan 1., 2013, to focus
on philanthropy and political activism, particularly pushing for advancements in
alternative energy.
Steyer attended the Buckley School, Philips Exeter Academy and graduated from
Yale University summa cum laude in economics and political science and was elected
to Phi Beta Kappa. He was captain of the Yale soccer team. Steyer received his MBA
from Stanford Business School, where he was an Arjay Miller Scholar.
In 2010, Steyer and his wife Kathryn Ann Taylor signed the Giving Pledge.</div>

                <div>Commentary: <br /> Steyer is a huge proponent of alternative energy, as well as a strong believer in
philanthrocapitalism. He directs his giving toward projects and institutions that promote
environmental sustainability, and are also working toward commercial viability, primarily funding
research and policy centers at the universities, and engaging in political advocacy.

“I don’t really consider [what I do] philanthropy,” says Tom Steyer. Instead, he thrills at the
challenge of overcoming obstacles to accomplish the things he thinks are important.

Community banking is one of three causes – “good food, good banking, and good energy,” – that
anchors Steyer’s philanthropy in order to narrow the rich-poor divide and address the “moral blind
spots” of our generation.</div>
